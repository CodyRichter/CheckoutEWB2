# CheckoutEWB2: Payment Management System

CheckoutEWB2 is a complete redesign of the original CheckoutEWB project (https://github.com/Senarii/CheckoutEWB). This is a system designed for the Engineers Without Borders UMass chapter to better keep track of details during the yearly auction, and to improve efficiency of the checkout process.

The program is meant to manage all of the transactions that take place at the auction, which means that it tracks guests, auction items, add-on items, donations, etc in order to remove the excessive amounts of folders and paper forms that were formerly used to complete this process.

Additionally, the program has support for data saving/loading, and will automatically load data from CSV files on program start. Furthermore, the data in the program can be saved at any time for future use.
